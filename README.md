This repository implements the requirements of the Tech Challenge requested by WSECU for a Backend developer position

The requirements for this challenge are as follows:

A user model must have at least these fields:
    - username
    - name
    - email
 
The solution be able to meet the following needs:
    - Find a user by username
    - Create a user
    - Delete a user
    - Update a user's email and name

Not included in the requirements is anything dealing with security, so none has been included.
